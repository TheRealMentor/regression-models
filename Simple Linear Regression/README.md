# Simple Linear Regression
Simple Linear Regression is the very basic model of regression and is the best way to start learning about Machine Learning. Linear regression is the simplest model among all the regression model. It is a model with single independent variable/feature. Plot of a simple linear regression can be seen below. As from the plot you can see it is the linear relationship between the dependent variable (y) and independent variable (X). The blue line is the what we use in the model to predict from a given input. Basically, the blue line is best fit line that is obtained using the <strong>LinearRegression</strong> algorithm from the <strong>sklearn.linear_model</strong>.

The red dots are the data points that are plotted from the dataset.

### Conclusion
As you can see, the blue line that the model suggests is the best fit line given the dataset.
