# Polynomial Regression
This type of regression is somewhat similar to the multiple regression. Only difference between them is the number of features. In this regression model, the number of features is only one. As you can see from the graph below, the graph of a polynomial regression is a curve. It's degree depends upon the type of data and can be found out by trial and error method. 


## Scenario
So, here we have a dataset in which different position levels and their corresponding salaries are stated in a particular company. Now a position is vacant and people are being interviewed. Now, the recruiter wants to know whether the person is telling the truth or is he bluffing about the salary that he was being paid in the last company that he worked for.


## Data
| Position | Level | Salary |
|-----------------|:-------------|:---------------:|
| Business Analyst | 1 | 45000
| Junior Consultant | 2 | 50000
| Senior Consultant | 3 | 60000
| Manager | 4 | 80000
| Country Manager | 5 | 110000
| Region Manager | 6 | 150000
| Partner | 7 | 200000
| Senior Partner | 8 | 300000
| C-level | 9 | 500000
| CEO | 10 | 1000000
