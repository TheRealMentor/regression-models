# Polynomial Regression
This type of regression is somewhat similar to the multiple regression. Only difference between them is the number of features in this regression model is only one. As you can see from the graph below, the graph of a polynomial regression is a curve. It's degree depends upon the type of data and can be found out by trial and error method.
