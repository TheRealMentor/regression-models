# Support Vector Regression (SVR)
This type of regression is a part of Support Vector Machine. A **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyper-plane. In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyper-plane which categorizes new examples. In two dimensional space this hyper-plane is a line dividing a plane in two parts where in each class lay in either side.

## Scenario
So, here we have a dataset in which different position levels and their corresponding salaries are stated in a particular company. Now a position is vacant and people are being interviewed. Now, the recruiter wants to know whether the person is telling the truth or is he bluffing about the salary that he was being paid in the last company that he worked for.

## Data
| Position | Level | Salary |
|-----------------|:-------------|:---------------:|
| Business Analyst | 1 | 45000
| Junior Consultant | 2 | 50000
| Senior Consultant | 3 | 60000
| Manager | 4 | 80000
| Country Manager | 5 | 110000
| Region Manager | 6 | 150000
| Partner | 7 | 200000
| Senior Partner | 8 | 300000
| C-level | 9 | 500000
| CEO | 10 | 1000000
